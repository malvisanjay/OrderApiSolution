# OrderApiSolution

The OrderApi solution contains two projects, 1. Rest API which handles the incoming reuest from the client and performs CRUD operations and storing data into Sql server. 2. Front end client application listing the Orders page wise, having Action items like Edit and Delete, once click on Edit it will show record on modal popup with data. Currently its just display on popup.
